The final bootscreen file must have the following specs so it works:
format: MPEG-4 Video (DIVX)
resolution: 720x480
framerate: 25

The file bootscreen_animated.avi already has this format.
For flashing onto the MMB-322 this file must be integrated into the sysconf-partition.
Actually this was never tested.
